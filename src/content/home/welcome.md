# Hey 👋

I'm a software engineer based in Glasgow, Scotland. Please explore my [blog](/blog) ✍️ and check out my projects 🛠️.

Previously, I contributed at organisations such as [Globality](https://globality.com), [SAS Institute](https://sas.com), [Doist](https://doist.com) and [J.P. Morgan Chase](https://jpmorgan.com).

I hold an MSc in Data Analytics and a BSc in Software Engineering from [The University of Glasgow](https://gla.ac.uk).

I enjoy distance running 🏃‍♂️‍➡️, programming 💻, metal music 🤘, and video games 🎮.
